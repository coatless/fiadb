To install Postgres on OS X, you have two options:
1. Download the full blown, always running, enterprise level Postgres Installer: http://www.enterprisedb.com/products/pgdownload.do#osx
2. Download the two separate applications that run on demand

In the case of option 2, the install is:
Step 1: Download Postgres.app: http://postgresapp.com/

Step 2: Download pgAdmin3: http://www.pgadmin.org/download/macosx.php

Step 3: Enable psql within terminal via symbolic link
sudo ln -s "/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/bin/psql" /usr/local/bin/psql

Step 4: Launch Postgres everytime you want to use postgresql. (An elephant will appear as an icon in the task bar)
